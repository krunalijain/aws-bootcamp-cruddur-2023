# Week X â€” Sync Tool for Static Website Hosting and CleanUp

This is the last week where I have worked on Cleaning the code and Static Website hosting- deploying the Cruddur Application on Production Environment. 
So firstly, I created a [`static-built`](https://github.com/krunalijain/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/bin/frontend/static-build) file for frontend.
