# Week 11 â€” CloudFormation Part 2

After the completion of Networking & Cluster Stak I move forward with implementing of RDS(Postgres), Sevice, DynamoDB & CICD stacks in AWS CloudFormation.

As created for previous stacks, similarly, here also I created a `template.yaml` & `config.toml` for RDS DataBase Configuration. And a `db` deploy script which will deploy the CFN Stack. 

## RDS (postgres) Stack

`config.toml`
```
[deploy]
bucket = 'cfn-artifacts-20'
region = 'us-east-1'
stack_name = 'CrdDb'

[parameters]
NetworkingStack = 'CrdNet'
ClusterStack = 'CrdCluster'
MasterUsername = 'cruddurroot'
```

Here's the `template.yaml` [code](https://github.com/krunalijain/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/cfn/db/template.yaml).

### Template File Key Points
- I have set the Parameters that can be referred later in the Resources. 
- There's a **Deletion Policy** & **Update Policy** -> which will take a **Snapshot** when you Delete & do an Update.
- Set **Delete Protection: False**, orelse you won't be able to delete it if required in future. 
- Here, I have set **BackupRetentionPeriod: 0** as it's for learning and exploring purpose but, in real life scenarios we shouldn't be setting it to `0` as we don't want our data to loose.
- Used Db Instance Class as `db.t4g.micro` as it has `arm` - has fewer instruction sets(codes) which makes work more efficient. 
- Engine set to postgres
- Set **MasterUsername**. Make sure never set the Default MasterUsename. That is been used to acquire access to your DataBase.
- I added my CONNECTION_URL endpoint in the Parameter store.
- Also set DB_PASSWORD as a gitpod env var before running the script.

## Service Stack (Backend)
Created a [`config.toml`](https://github.com/krunalijain/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/cfn/service/config.toml), [`template.yaml`](https://github.com/krunalijain/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/cfn/service/template.yaml) and [`service`](https://github.com/krunalijain/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/bin/cfn/service) bash script for stack deploying in CFN. It consists of:

### Service Stack Troubleshooting
When I tried to deploy and execute change set of my Service Stack, I got an error **CCreate Service Error: SC service is already used by service discovery namespace**.

### Solution 
To solve this I had to change the namespaces and match them in other stack files also.
