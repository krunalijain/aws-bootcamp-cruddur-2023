# Week 7 â€” Solving CORS with a Load Balancer and Custom Domain
As both week 6-7 were merged, so it is hard to segregate things between these two weeks. Till now we have created a service for Backend in our ECS cluster and done with the Health-Check. Here we have fixed the Messaging in the Prod Environment and succefully created a Frontend Service in ECS cluster with success health-check status.

Also restructured our bash scripts for `build`, `Tag & Push`, `Force Deploy`, `Register`.
