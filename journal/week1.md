# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Homework Required
## Attended Live Session 
This live session was a leveled up compared to Week-0. Here we got to know about the working of **Guest OS, Host OS and the Containers**. We also **created a Docker file** in this instructional live video. Also ran some of the **Python scripts**. Experienced the guidance from the Docker experts : ***James Spurin*** and ***Edith Puclla***. Installed the Docker Extension in Gtipod. And understood the working of code in Dockerfile. 

## Tasks Completed
We built an image via Gitpod. **Launched the micro blogging app - Cruddur on a localhost**. For this we created `frontend-react-js` file and a `backend-flask` file which were connected. There was a `docker-compose.yml` file which included both frontend and backend file's links. We need to **compose up** to activate the ports that helped us to run the Cruddur app. The `port 4567` was for the backend and the `port 3000` was for the frontend.

Then, we set the notifications feature in this cruddur app. While setting this notification I faced few errors which later on I managed to troubleshoot and some of the bootcampers helped me to find and solve the error.

## Troubleshooted Errors
### The Error
There was a problem when I ran the port 3000 for the frontend thing and I could see the error message **404 Not Found**.
